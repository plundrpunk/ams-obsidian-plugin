## 2026-04-27 - DocumentFragment for Obsidian Modals
**Learning:** Obsidian modals typically render lists of elements (like search results or graphs) sequentially to a parent DOM node, causing multiple reflows/repaints per render. The Obsidian `Node` interface polyfills `createDiv`/`createEl` on `DocumentFragment`s as well, so we can use standard DOM batching techniques without losing the clean Obsidian DOM builder API.
**Action:** When rendering lists of items in custom Modals (Search, Graphs), build the items inside a `document.createDocumentFragment()` and append the fragment to the container once at the end.

## 2026-05-04 - Debouncing disk I/O in Obsidian Settings
**Learning:** In Obsidian plugins, `saveData()` triggers disk I/O writes to the plugin's `data.json` file. Binding synchronous `saveData()` calls to `onChange` events in text inputs within the Settings tab can cause significant performance bottlenecks and UI lag due to frequent, redundant disk writes on every keystroke.
**Action:** Use Obsidian's built-in `debounce` utility (imported from `obsidian`) to wrap `saveData()` calls originating from frequent UI events (like text inputs). Retain synchronous `saveData()` for critical state transitions (e.g., onboarding completion) to guarantee data persistence.

## 2026-05-11 - Fast-path validation to avoid large string allocations
**Learning:** In applications dealing with file contents or large string payloads, validating the entire payload against a short literal (like a specific error message) using string-copying methods like `.trim()` causes unnecessary memory allocations and garbage collection overhead.
**Action:** Before invoking string transformations on potentially massive strings, use a fast-path length check against the length of the literal being matched. If the payload length significantly exceeds the literal, skip the transformation.
